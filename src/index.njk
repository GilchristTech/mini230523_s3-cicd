		<h1>It's May 23rd, 2023</h1>
		<p>And this is a mini-website project. I like to work on single-day projects
			which reinforce things I've learned, taking a focus on speed and
			recollection. Today's project is a CI/CD pipeline for a static site using
			AWS S3 buckets, GitHub actions, and a small blog-style site made in
			<a href="https:www.11ty.dev">11ty</a>.</p>
		<p>The site itself is a project log of itself, a "plog", if you will.</p>
