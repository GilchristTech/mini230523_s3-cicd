title: Wrapping up
---

It's getting late, and I'd like to do a few more of those frontend tweaks I was
earlier regretting giving too much focus. I fancied up the plog post list on the
index, did a couple text revisions, and reworked the header and footer. I also
deleted the plog index at `/plog/`, as it's redundant with the same content on
the site index.

This has been a ten-hour development session today! The project I did a couple
days ago, had actually taken place over multiple days. Part of the point of
these single-day projects, which I've taken to calling "mini-websites" or
"mini-projects", is getting faster at more complex tasks, memorizing tools I
use.

I will likely repeat a similar project to this one, and I expect my time will be
drastically lower!
